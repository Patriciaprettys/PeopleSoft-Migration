# Migration Plan: Workday → PeopleSoft


## Scope & Objectives
- Migrate departmental HR data and processes from Workday to PeopleSoft.
- Maintain compliance and data integrity; avoid business disruption.
- Success = zero critical data loss; payroll and benefits validated in parallel runs.

## Stakeholders
- **Project Lead:** Patricia Nelson
- **HR SME(s):** Dept HR partners
- **IT SMEs:** PeopleSoft admin, Integration engineer
- **Payroll/Benefits:** Payroll lead, Benefits admin
- **Vendors:** Workday support (read access), PeopleSoft support

## Approach
- **Phased big-bang:** Single cutover weekend with 2-week hypercare.
- **Environments:** DEV → TEST → UAT → PROD.
- **Data strategy:** Extract from Workday (reports/API), transform, and load to PeopleSoft via CI/CI or Component Interfaces.

## Milestones
1. Planning & Requirements (4 wks)
2. Data Mapping & Cleansing (3 wks)
3. Configuration & Integrations (6 wks)
4. Testing & Parallel Runs (4 wks)
5. Training & Change Mgmt (2 wks)
6. Go‑Live & Hypercare (2 wks)

## Deliverables
- Data mapping workbook, conversion scripts, test plan/results, training assets, cutover runbook, rollback plan.

## Cutover (Runbook excerpt)
- Freeze changes in Workday (dept scope).
- Final extract and delta reconciliation.
- Load to PeopleSoft in sequence: Job/Position → Job Data → Comp → Benefits → Time/Absence balances.
- Validate dashboards and downstream feeds (reports, payroll).
- Sign-offs: HR, Payroll, Project Lead.

## Rollback
- If critical defects found, revert to pre-cutover snapshot; lift freeze; schedule new window.

## Assumptions & Constraints
- Only department-scope data moves; no historical payroll recalculation.
- SSO/role mapping prepared ahead.

## Acceptance Criteria
- 100% headcount migrated; pay group assignments correct; first payroll parallel within ±0.5% variance; zero P1 defects in hypercare.
