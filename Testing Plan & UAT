# Testing Plan & UAT: Workday → PeopleSoft


## Test Levels
1. **Unit/Config Tests** – Validate PeopleSoft configuration (Job Codes, Positions, Pay Groups).
2. **System/Integration Tests** – Validate interfaces (SSO, payroll feed, reporting refresh).
3. **Data Conversion Tests** – Sample loads, full mock conversion, and final mock with reconciliations.
4. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** – HR/Payroll SMEs validate end-to-end processes.

## Test Scenarios (examples)
- Create/Update Employee; Transfer; Termination; Rehire; Leave; Benefits enrollment change; Payroll calc preview; Time capture and approval; Security role checks.

## Parallel Payroll
- **Runs:** 2 parallels before go‑live.
- **Variance threshold:** ±0.5% per employee and total run.
- **Reconciliation reports:** Headcount, Job, Comp, Deduction, Benefit premiums.

## Entry/Exit Criteria
- **Entry to UAT:** Config baselined; conversion mock passed.
- **Exit UAT:** No open High/Critical defects; signed business approval.

## Defect Management
- Severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low); SLA targets; daily triage; fix/verify loop in UAT window.
